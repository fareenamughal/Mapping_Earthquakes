# Mapping_Earthquakes
Module 14: Mapping Earthquakes with JS &amp; APIs
---
## Overview
---
The project aimed to use Leaflet api library, CSS stle sheets, Mapbox and Html files to display earthquake data using different base maps and overlays. One of the aims was to provide customised and easy visualization based on each users search criteria.

The earthquake data was formatted using geoJSON from two main sources:
Current week earthquake data 
and current week major earthquake data with magnitude .4.5

### Main deliverables 
---
1. Adding tectonic plate as second layer group, developing and overlay object for this and generating the map inclusive of these.
2. Adding another layer group of major earthquakes with a magnitude of over 4.5 as a layer and overlay object and generating a map including this.
3. Adding a third map tile layer. I have also included a fourth!.

### Results

The result for all the above 3 deliverables can be viewed from the htlm file which is loading well and displaying all the component as outlined in the deliverables.
